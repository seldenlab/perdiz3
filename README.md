# Perdiz arrow points from Caddo burial contexts aid in defining discrete behavioral regions

Recent research in the ancestral Caddo area has yielded evidence for distinct behavioral regions, across which material culture from Caddo burials—bottles and Gahagan bifaces—was found to express significant morphological differences. This inquiry asks whether Perdiz arrow points from Caddo burials differ across the same geography, extending the pattern of shape differences to a third category of Caddo material culture. Perdiz arrow points collected from the geographies of the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions were employed to test the hypothesis that morphological attributes differ, and are predictable, between the two communities. Results indicate a significant between-community difference in morphology. Using the same traditional metrics combined with the tools of machine learning, a predictive model---support vector machine---was designed to assess the degree to which community differences could be predicted, achieving a receiver operator curve score of 97 percent, and an accuracy score of 94 percent. The subsequent geometric morphometric analysis identified significant differences in Perdiz arrow point shape and size, coupled with significant results for modularity and morphological integration. These findings bolster recent research that posited two behavioral regions in the ancestral Caddo area defined on the basis of discernible morphological differences across three categories of Caddo material culture.
