>“The question of questions for mankind—the problem which underlies all others, and is more deeply interesting than any other—is the ascertainment of the place which man occupies in nature, and of his relation to the universe of things.” **–H. Thomas Henry Huxley**, _Man’s Place in Nature_

## Basis of inquiry

Recent research into Caddo bottle and biface morphology yielded evidence for two distinct behavioral regions, across which material culture from Caddo burials expresses significant morphological differences. This study asks whether Perdiz arrow points from Caddo burials differ across the same geography, which would extend the pattern of morphological differences to a third category of Caddo material culture. Perdiz arrow points collected from the geographies of the northern and southern Caddo behavioral regions were employed to test the hypothesis that morphological attributes differ, and are predictable, between the two communities. The analysis of linear metrics indicated a significant difference in morphology by behavioral region. Using the linear metrics combined with the tools of machine learning, a predictive model---support vector machine---was designed to assess the degree to which community differences could be predicted, achieving a receiver operator curve score of 97 percent, and an accuracy score of 94 percent. The subsequent landmark geometric morphometric analysis identified significant differences in Perdiz arrow point shape and size between the behavioral regions---one characterized by a comparatively smaller blade and larger stem (north), and the other by a comparatively larger blade and smaller stem (south)---coupled with significant results for modularity and morphological integration. These findings build directly upon recent investigations that posited two discrete Caddo behavioral regions defined on the basis of discernible morphological differences, which is expanded here to include a third category of Caddo material culture.

## Primary findings

### Linear morphometrics

Sixty seven whole/intact Perdiz arrow points recovered from Caddo burial contexts in Camp, Nacogdoches, and Shelby counties comprise the basis of this study. A standard suite of linear metrics were collected for each specimen, including maximum length, width, thickness, stem length, and stem width. Following collection, data were imported to R [@RN8584], where boxplots were produced, along with a principal components analysis (PCA), followed by a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) to test whether the morphology of Perdiz arrow points differs between the behavioral regions.

```{r botjarbox, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Boxplots for a, maximum length; b, maximum width; c, maximum thickness; d, stem length; e, stem width, and f, PCA [on correlation matrix] for linear metrics associated with the Perdiz arrow points."}
knitr::include_graphics('./fig/figure2.png')
```

Boxplots illustrate the distribution and mean for each of the five linear variables, and the PCA illustrates over 92 percent of the variation in the sample among PC1 (84.65 percent) and PC2 (11.71 percent). The perMANOVA demonstrated that linear metrics for Perdiz arrow points differ significantly by behavioral region (permutations = 10,000; Rsq = 0.29485; Pr(>F) = 1e-04).

* Perdiz arrow point morphology *differs significantly* by Caddo community

### Machine learning

A _support vector machine_ is a supervised machine learning model regularly used in classifying archaeological materials [@RN9515;@RN9516;@RN9514;@RN9513;@RN10755;@RN10754], which has utility in comparing and classifying datasets aggregated from digital repositories, comparative collections, open access reports, as well as other digital assets. For this effort, linear data were imported and modeled using the `scikit-learn` package in Python [@scikit-learn;@sklearn_api], and subsequently split into training (75 percent) and testing (25 percent) subsets. A standard scaler was used to decrease the sensitivity of the algorithm to outliers by standardizing features, and a nested cross validation of the training set was used to achieve unbiased estimates of model performance.

* Model achieved a *cross validation score of 86 percent*
* Model achieved a *receiver operator curve score of 97 percent*
* Model achieved an *accuracy score of 94 percent*

### Geometric morphometrics

Each of the arrow points was imaged using a flatbed scanner (HP Scanjet G4050) at 600 dpi. The landmarking protocol developed for this study included six landmarks and 24 equidistant semilandmarks to characterize Perdiz arrow point shape, and were applied using the `StereoMorph` package in R [@RN8973]. The characteristic points and tangents used in the landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff [@RN5700].

#### Generalised Procrustes Analysis

Landmarks were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN8102;@RN8587;@RN8384], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN8525], performed in R [@RN8584] using the `geomorph` package [@RN8565;@RN9565]. Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data allowing for comparisons among objects [@RN5698;@RN8525]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN8511;@RN8384].

#### Principal Components Analysis

Principal components analysis [@RN8576;@RN10875] was used to visualize shape variation among the arrow points. Shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image or 3D mesh [@RN8555;@RN8553]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN8579;@RN8334], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN6995]. To assess whether shape differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN7046] were also run that enlist effect-sizes (z-scores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN8560]. Procrustes variance was used to discriminate between regions and compare the amount of shape variation (morphological disparity) [@RN5703], estimated as Procrustes variance using residuals of linear model fit [@RN8314]. A pairwise comparison of morphological integration was used to test the strength of integration between blade and basal morphology using a z-score [@RN8588;@RN8560;@RN8340;@RN10874].

```{r gmpca, out.width = "100%", dpi = 300, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Principal components analysis plot (PC1/PC2) for Perdiz arrow points by behavioral region/community (top; gray squares, north; orange triangles, south), and results of modularity (bottom left) and blade/base morphological integration (bottom right) analyses."}
knitr::include_graphics('./ms/perdiz3/ms-figs/figure4.jpg')
```

The analysis of modularity, which compares within-module covariation of landmarks against between-module covariation was significant [@RN10874;@RN5170], demonstrating that Perdiz arrow point blades and bases are, in fact, modular. The test for morphological integration was also significant, indicating that the blades and bases of Perdiz arrow points are integrated. These results demonstrate that blade and base shapes for Perdiz arrow points are predictable; a finding that would have utility in subsequent studies of Perdiz arrow point morphology that incorporate fragmentary specimens.

A Procrustes ANOVA was used to test for a difference in Perdiz arrow point (centroid) size by behavioral region (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.30681; Pr(>F) = 1e-04), followed by a second to test for a difference in arrow point shape (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.0536; Pr(>F) = 0.0161). While shape and size differ significantly between behavioral regions, the Rsq value for size is just under six times larger than that for shape (smaller in the north; larger in the south), suggesting that between-region differences in Perdiz arrow point _size_ may be more visually apparent than differences in _shape_. A comparison of mean consensus configurations was used to illustrate shape differences from the northern and southern behavioral regions. Diacritical morphology is characterized by a comparatively smaller blade and larger stem in the north, and by a comparatively larger blade and smaller stem in the south. Further, the angle between the shoulder and base is more acute, with a base that is generally shorter and narrower in the southern behavioral region.

* Perdiz arrow points exhibit *significant* modularity

The replicable nature of this undertaking provides others with the means to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. 

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN8322;@RN8980;@RN11097], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have—explicitly or implicitly—a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
