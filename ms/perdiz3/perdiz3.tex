\begin{abstract}
Recent research in the ancestral Caddo area yielded evidence for
distinct \emph{behavioral regions}, across which material culture from
Caddo burials---bottles and Gahagan bifaces---has been found to express
significant morphological differences. This inquiry assesses whether
Perdiz arrow points from Caddo burials, assumed to reflect design
intent, may differ across the same geography, and extend the pattern of
shape differences to a third category of Caddo material culture. Perdiz
arrow points collected from the geographies of the northern and southern
Caddo \emph{behavioral regions} defined in a recent social network
analysis were employed to test the hypothesis that morphological
attributes differ, and are predictable, between the two communities.
Results indicate significant between-community differences in maximum
length, width, stem length, and stem width, but not thickness. Using the
same traditional metrics combined with the tools of machine learning, a
predictive model---support vector machine---was designed to assess the
degree to which community differences could be predicted, achieving a
receiver operator curve score of 97 percent, and an accuracy score of 94
percent. The subsequent geometric morphometric analysis identified
significant differences in Perdiz arrow point shape, size, and
allometry, coupled with significant results for modularity and
morphological integration. These findings bolster recent arguments that
established two discrete \emph{behavioral regions} in the ancestral
Caddo area defined on the basis of discernible morphological differences
across three categories of Caddo material culture.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}}

Perdiz arrow points (Fig.1) are considered the epitome of the Late
Prehistoric Toyah lithic assemblage in Texas---which also includes
convex end scrapers or unifaces, prismatic blades, as well as two- and
four-beveled bifacial knives---and are representative of the Late
Prehistoric transition to the Protohistoric \cite{RN9718}. This
technological assemblage is typically attributed to groups of highly
mobile bison hunters, and has been documented across the full extent of
Texas. Our present understanding of the Toyah tool kit indicates that it
was successfully implemented in a broad-spectrum of hunting and foraging
lifeways that included not only bison (\emph{Bison bison}), but deer
(\emph{Odocoileus spp.}) and numerous other animal prey species
\cite{RN9718,RN9786}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{ms-figs/figure0} \caption{Perdiz arrow points used in this study come from Caddo burial contexts at the Tuck Carpenter (41CP5), Johns (41CP12), B. J. Horton (41CP20), Washington Square Mound (41NA49), and Morse Mound (41SY27) sites in northeast Texas. Additional information for each Perdiz arrow point, including the option to download full-resolution 2D images of individual projectiles, can be found at https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/ita-perdiz/.}\label{fig:fig0}
\end{figure}

While Perdiz arrow points have not been used to address more complex
research issues, the Toyah tool kit was recognized as a potential
contributor to discussions of Late Prehistoric social and cultural
identity. Initially identified by J. Charles Kelley on the basis of
technological and morphological differences in material culture, the
Toyah Phase (CE 1300 - 1700) occured between the Protohistoric and the
preceding Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric Period
\cite{RN9719,RN9720}. As noted by Arnn:

\begin{quote}
Toyah represents something of a paradox in which archaeologists have
identified one archaeological or material culture in the same region
where historians have documented numerous Native American groups and
significant cultural diversity \cite[47]{RN9718}.
\end{quote}

Stemming from the observations of Kelley, as well as later researchers
who viewed Toyah as a cultural entity, technological origins became a
point of further interest and debate from which two schools of thought
emerged regarding Toyah cultural manifestations: 1) that Toyah
represented the technology of Plains groups moving into Texas following
the bison herds \cite{RN9721,RN9722}, or 2) a \emph{technocomplex} or
suite of artifacts adopted by multiple distinct groups across Texas as
they participated in bison hunting \cite{RN9008,RN9723,RN9724}. In both
interpretations, primary agency is environmental \cite{RN9718}; either
people followed the bison from elsewhere, or the influx of bison spurred
adoption of the technology among the numerous distinct groups in Texas.

Research by Arnn \cite{RN9718,RN9716,RN5784,RN9717} emphasized aspects
of Toyah social identity, social fields, and agency, as well as the
archaeological visibility of these phenomena. Arnn recognized three
important scales of identity and interaction in his work:
community/band, marriage/linguistic group, and long-distance social
networks \cite{RN9718}. His ideas are important here because they
supplant a simple monocausal environmental explanation of material
culture variability with a multi-causal and scaled concept that includes
\emph{social identity}.

\subsection{Perdiz arrow points}\label{perdiz-arrow-points}}

Perdiz arrow points generally follow two distinct manufacturing
trajectories; one that enlists flakes, and the other, blade flakes
\cite{RN8999,RN9361,RN9000,RN9364}, and encompass a greater range of
variation in shape and size than most arrow point types in Texas
\cite{RN7795,RN3149}. Lithic tool stone in the ancestral Caddo area of
northeast Texas is relatively sparse, consists primarily of chert,
quartzite, and silicified wood characteristic of the local geological
formations, which may contribute to local variation in shape and size
\cite{RN9364,RN439}. It has been demonstrated elsewhere that
morphological attributes of Perdiz arrow points from northeast Texas
vary significantly by time, raw material, and burial context
\cite{RN9364}. In outline, Perdiz arrow points possess a:

\begin{quote}
{[}t{]}riangular blade with edges usually quite straight but sometimes
slightly convex or concave. Shoulders sometimes at right angles to stem
but usually well barbed. Stem contracted, often quite sharp at base, but
may be somewhat rounded. Occasionally, specimen may be worked on one
face only or mainly on one face \ldots{} {[}w{]}orkmanship generally
good, sometimes exceedingly fine with minutely serrated blade edges
\cite[504]{RN5769}.
\end{quote}

A social network analysis of diagnostic artifacts from Historic Caddo
(post-CE 1680) sites in northeast Texas demonstrated two spatially
distinct \emph{behavioral regions} \cite{RN8031} (Fig. 2). The network
analysis was limited to Historic Caddo types; however, Formative Early
Caddo (CE 800 -- 1200) Gahagan bifaces and Caddo bottle types have been
found to express significant morphological variability following the
same geographic extent \cite{RN8074,RN7927,RN8370,RN8312}, extending the
prehistoric longevity for the \emph{behavioral regions} based on local
alterity. Gahagan bifaces from the ancestral Caddo area also differ
significantly in shape, size, and form compared with those recovered
from central Texas sites \cite{RN8322}, suggesting a second \emph{shape
boundary} between the ancestral Caddo area and central Texas.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{ms-figs/figure1} \caption{Historic Caddo network (CE 1680+) generated using the co-presence of diagnostic ceramic and lithic types---which include Perdiz arrow points---illustrating the ancestral Caddo region (gray outline) and the two (north [blue] and south [red]) Caddo behavioral regions (Selden 2021). The regions were identified using a modularity statistic to identify those nodes more densely connected to one another than to the rest of the network.}\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

The goal of this exploratory endeavor was to assess whether metrics
collected for Perdiz arrow points support the \emph{shape boundary}
posited in recent social network and geometric morphometric analyses, to
determine whether linear metrics and shape variables might be useful
predictors of regional membership, and---if so---to identify those
morphological features that articulate with each \emph{behavioral
region}. It is assumed that complete Perdiz arrow points included as
offerings in Caddo burials represent the \emph{design intent} of the
maker. Should the analysis yield significant results, it would bolster
the argument for at least two discrete Caddo \emph{behavioral regions}
in northeast Texas; each empirically defined by discernible
morphological differences across three discrete categories of Caddo
material culture.

\hypertarget{caddo-behavioral-regions}{%
\subsection{Caddo behavioral regions}\label{caddo-behavioral-regions}}

In a June 18, 1937 Works Progress Administration interview with Lillian
Cassaway, Sadie Bedoka---a Caddo-Delaware woman raised with the
Caddo---stated that:

\begin{quote}
Each {[}Caddo{]} clan had its own shape to make its pottery. One clan
never thought of making anything the same pattern of another clan.
\emph{You could tell who made the pottery by the shape}
\cite[395]{RN9357x}.
\end{quote}

General differences in Caddo ceramic forms have been noted elsewhere
\cite{RN5650,RN7162}; however, the study of the Clarence H. Webb
collection was the first to illustrate a significant north-south
geographic shape difference among Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain
Caddo bottle types \cite{RN8370}. That preliminary observation was later
confirmed using more robust samples of Hickory Engraved and Smithport
Plain bottles \cite{RN8074,RN7927}, then expanded to include a greater
variety of Caddo bottle types across a larger spatial and temporal
extent \cite{RN8312}.

The co-presence of diagnostic artifact and attribute types has been used
to define Caddo phases and periods, which serve as a heuristic tool that
aids archaeologists in explaining the local cultural landscape, as well
as regional differences between local landscapes. The Historic Caddo
network expands those efforts, augmenting the previously-defined phases
and periods, and emphasizing the dynamic and manifold relational
connections that reinforce and transcend the currently categories
\cite{RN8031}. This was achieved by enlisting a multi-scalar
methodological approach \cite{RN5644,RN8039}, where northern and
southern communities were parsed into constituent groups using the
co-presence of diagnostic types paired with a modularity algorithm
\cite{RN8051,RN8024}. Most of the constituent groups identified in the
network analysis were found to articulate with known Caddo polities,
while others were not \cite{RN8031}.

A subsequent analysis of Gahagan bifaces confirmed that a second
category of Caddo material culture expressed significant morphological
differences across the same geography as the Hickory Engraved and
Smithport Plain bottles \cite{RN8158}. The morphology of Gahagan bifaces
from sites in central Texas was later found to differ significantly when
compared with those recovered from the Caddo region \cite{RN8322}. That
Gahagan bifaces were found to differ across two \emph{spatial
boundaries} was noteworthy, particularly since it has regularly been
assumed that these large bifaces were manufactured in central Texas and
arrived in the ancestral Caddo area as products of trade and/or exchange
\cite{RN8322,RN8158}. Further, that Gahagan bifaces were found to differ
across the same geography as those communities posited in the Historic
Caddo network analysis suggested that the temporal range of the
\emph{shape boundary} might extend to the Formative/Early Caddo period
(CE 800 - 1250); a hypothesis that was later confirmed in a more
comprehensive analysis of Caddo bottles \cite{RN8312}.

\hypertarget{methods-and-results}{%
\section{Methods and results}\label{methods-and-results}}

Sixty seven intact Perdiz arrow points recovered from Caddo burial
contexts in Camp, Nacogdoches, and Shelby counties comprise the basis of
this study (\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary
materials}). A standard suite of linear metrics were collected for each
specimen, including maximum length, width, thickness, stem length, and
stem width. Following collection, data were imported to R 4.1.1
\cite{RN8584} (\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary
materials}), where boxplots were produced, along with a Principal
Components Analysis (PCA) followed by analyses of variance (ANOVA) to
test whether the morphology of Perdiz arrow points differs across the
shape boundary (Fig.2).

Boxplots illustrate the distribution and mean for each of the five
variables (Fig. 3a-e), and the PCA (Fig. 3f) illustrates over 92 percent
of the variation in the sample among PC1 (84.65 percent) and PC2 (11.71
percent). ANOVAs demonstrate significant differences in Perdiz arrow
point morphology among four of the five variables (maximum length,
width, stem length, and stem width)
(\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials}).
Maximum thickness does not differ significantly between the northern and
southern communities, which led to the decision to conduct the
subsequent geometric morphometric analysis as a two dimensional, rather
than a three-dimensional, study
(\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials}).

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{predictive-model}{%
\subsection{Predictive model}\label{predictive-model}}

A \emph{support vector machine} is a supervised machine learning model
regularly used in classifying archaeological materials
\cite{RN9515,RN9516,RN9514,RN9513,RN10755,RN10754}, which has utility in
comparing and classifying datasets aggregated from digital repositories,
comparative collections, open access reports, as well as other digital
assets. For this effort, linear data were imported and modeled using the
\texttt{scikit-learn} package in Python \cite{scikit-learn,sklearn_api}
(\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials}),
and subsequently split into training (75 percent) and testing (25
percent) subsets. A \emph{standard scaler} was used to decrease the
sensitivity of the algorithm to outliers by standardizing features, and
a \emph{nested cross validation} of the training set was used to achieve
unbiased estimates of model performance, resulting in a mean cross
validation score of 86 percent
(\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials}).
The model was subsequently fit on the training set, yielding a receiver
operator curve score of 97 percent, and an accuracy score of 94 percent
(\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials}).

\hypertarget{geometric-morphometrics}{%
\subsection{Geometric morphometrics}\label{geometric-morphometrics}}

Each of the arrow points was imaged using a flatbed scanner (HP Scanjet
G4050) at 600 dpi. The landmarking protocol developed for this study
(\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials})
included six landmarks and 24 equidistant semilandmarks to characterize
Perdiz arrow point shape, applied using the \texttt{StereoMorph} package
in R \cite{RN8973}. The characteristic points and tangents used in the
landmarking protocol were inspired by the work of Birkhoff
\cite{RN5700}.

Landmarks were aligned to a global coordinate system
\cite{RN8102,RN8587,RN8384}, achieved through generalized Procrustes
superimposition \cite{RN8525}, performed in R 4.1.1 \cite{RN8584} using
the \texttt{geomorph} package v4.0.1 \cite{RN8565,RN9565} (Fig.4).
Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the
coordinate data allowing for comparisons among objects
\cite{RN5698,RN8525}. The \texttt{geomorph} package uses a partial
Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into
tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of
multivariate methods that assume linear space \cite{RN8511,RN8384}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{ms-figs/figure3} \caption{Results of generalized Procrustes analysis, illustrating mean shape (black) and all specimens in the sample (gray). Additional information related to the GPA, including those data and code needed to reproduce these results, can be found in the supplemental materials at https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/.}\label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}

Principal components analysis \cite{RN8576} was used to visualize shape
variation among the arrow points (Fig. 5). The shape changes described
by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline
warping of a reference image or 3D mesh \cite{RN8555,RN8553}. A residual
randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was
used for all Procrustes ANOVAs \cite{RN8579,RN8334}, which has higher
statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data
should they be present \cite{RN6995}. To assess whether shape changes
with size (allometry), and differs by group (region), Procrustes ANOVAs
\cite{RN7046} were also run that enlist effect-sizes (z-scores) computed
as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions
\cite{RN8477}. Procrustes variance was used to discriminate between
regions and compare the amount of shape variation (morphological
disparity) \cite{RN5703}, estimated as Procrustes variance using
residuals of linear model fit \cite{RN8314}. A pairwise comparison of
morphological integration was used to test the strength of integration
between blade and basal morphology using a z-score \cite{RN8340}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{ms-figs/figure4} \caption{Principal components analysis plot (PC1/PC2) for Perdiz arrow points by behavioral region/community (top; gray squares, north; orange triangles, south), and results of modularity (bottom left) and blade/base morphological integration (bottom right) analyses. Additional information related to the PCA, including the full listing of results and those data and code needed to reproduce these results, can be found in the supplemental materials at https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/.}\label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

The analysis of modularity, which compares within-module covariation of
landmarks against between-module covariation was significant (Fig. 4 and
\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials}),
demonstrating that Perdiz arrow point blades and bases are, in fact,
modular. The test for morphological integration was also significant
(Fig. 4 and \href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary
materials}), indicating that the blades and bases of Perdiz arrow points
are integrated. These results demonstrate that blade and base shapes for
Perdiz arrow points are predictable; a finding that would have utility
in subsequent studies of Perdiz arrow point morphology that incorporate
fragmentary specimens.

A Procrustes ANOVA was used to test whether a significant difference
exists in Perdiz arrow point (centroid) size (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq =
0.30681; Pr(\textgreater F) = 1e-04), followed by another to test
whether a significant difference exists in arrow point shape by region
(northern vs.~southern) (RRPP = 10,000; Rsq = 0.0536; Pr(\textgreater F)
= 0.0161). A comparison of mean consensus configurations was used to
characterize intraspecific shape variation of Perdiz arrow points from
the northern and southern \emph{behavioral regions}. Diacritical
morphology occurs primarily in basal shape, where the angle between the
shoulder and base is more acute, and a base that is generally shorter
and narrower in the southern \emph{behavioral region} than it is in the
north (\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary
materials}).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

The \emph{shape boundary} empirically delineates two discrete
\emph{behavioral regions} in the ancestral Caddo area. That the Perdiz
arrow points recovered from Caddo burials north and south of the
\emph{shape boundary} were found to differ significantly, expands the
scope of the \emph{behavioral regions} to include three classes of
artifacts (Caddo bottles, bifaces, and---now---arrow points)
\cite{RN8074,RN7927,RN8370,RN8312,RN8322,RN8158}. For material culture
offerings included in burial contexts, the Caddo were \emph{selecting}
for significant morphological differences in bottles and bifaces
recovered from either side of the \emph{shape boundary} (Fig. 6).
Results clearly illustrate that those morphological differences among
Perdiz arrow points found in the northern and southern \emph{behavioral
regions} (Fig. 6d) are predictable
(\href{https://seldenlab.github.io/perdiz3/}{supplementary materials}),
and can be disaggregated using the standard suite of linear metrics
regularly collected in the context of cultural resource management
endeavors.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{ms-figs/figure6} \caption{Mean shapes and comparisons for a, Formative/Early and b, Late/Historic bottles; c, Formative/Early Gahagan bifaces; and d, Middle/Late Perdiz arrow points from Caddo burial contexts in the northern and southern behavioral regions. In the comparisons of mean shape, the northern population appears in gray, and the southern population appears in black.}\label{fig:fig5}
\end{figure}

The geometric morphometric analysis demonstrated significant
morphological differences for Perdiz arrow points recovered north and
south of the \emph{shape boundary}, where the most pronounced difference
was found to occur in basal morphology (Fig. 6). Allometry was also
found to be significant, demonstrating that Perdiz arrow point shape
differs with size. Those arrow points used in this study are considered
to represent \emph{design intent}, and are not thought to exhibit
retouch or resharpening. This finding provides evidence in support of
the argument that Perdiz arrow point morphology is labile \cite{RN9364}.
The character of those morphological differences found to occur in
Perdiz arrow points (basal morphology and size) is also suggestive of
differential approaches to the practice of hafting.

Blades and bases of Perdiz arrow points were found to be both modular
and morphologically integrated. This indicates that each module
functions independently, and that base shape is a predictor of blade
shape, and vice-versa. Further work is warranted to assess whether
Perdiz arrow points from groups within the boundaries of the northern
and southern \emph{behavioral regions} may express unique morphologies,
aiding in further delimiting local boundaries associated with
constituent Caddo groups.

\hypertarget{standardization-and-specialization}{%
\subsection{Standardization and
specialization}\label{standardization-and-specialization}}

Standardization has been conceptually linked to the notion of
approximating a perceived ideal through the realization of a mental
template \cite[156]{RN9715}. Morphological attributes are representative
of intentional attributes related to morphological characteristics
\cite{RN7051}, and dimensional standardization has utility in
identifying the range of variation and overlap of product morphology
both in and between communities \cite{RN5779}. Further, relative
dimensional standardization may imply a smaller number of production
units when contrasted with larger units \cite{RN7051}. Standardization
can also result from raw material selection and (for lithics) reduction
practices \cite{RN9712,RN9713,RN6494,RN9714}.

One common argument used to establish the presence of specialization
includes large quantities of highly standardized products interpreted as
representative of a single---or limited number of---production units
\cite{RN7019}. There also exists the possibility that an increase in
specialization can result in increased morphological diversity,
depending on the organization of production \cite{RN6451}. Correlations
between specialization and standardization have often, but not always,
been supported by ethnographic and experimental data
\cite{RN9725,RN9726,RN7137}. In the case of material culture from Caddo
burials in the northern and southern \emph{behavioral regions}, bottle
and biface morphologies communicate important information related to
group affiliation \cite{RN9727} through deliberate and differential
production (bottles) and aesthetic choices (bifaces). Differences in
Caddo bottle morphology have aided in the identification of two large
production units; one in each of the \emph{behavioral regions}, and it
is likely the case that each is comprised of a series of smaller
constituent production units bounded by geography and time.

While Caddo bottles are representative of a complete system---or
unit---the function of a biface (Perdiz arrow points and Gahagan bifaces
in this context) is more limited, in that they represent a singular
component of a much more dynamic system. Dimensional standardization in
size has been identified for both the Caddo bottles and Gahagan bifaces
\cite{RN8074,RN7927,RN8370,RN8312,RN8322}. The similarities and
differences in bottle shapes were found to transcend typological
assignments, and bottles from the northern \emph{behavioral region} have
been found to express a significantly greater diversity in size,
yielding evidence for size standardization in the southern
\emph{behavioral region} \cite{RN8312}. It is also the case that Gahagan
bifaces from the ancestral Caddo area have been found to express a
significantly greater diversity in size compared to those from central
Texas \cite{RN8322}. These findings suggest that social and
manufacturing tolerances, as they relate to Caddo burial traditions, may
have been guided by regionally-specific morphological traits that
signaled group \emph{identity}.

\hypertarget{morphologically-distinct-behavioral-regions}{%
\subsection{Morphologically-distinct behavioral
regions}\label{morphologically-distinct-behavioral-regions}}

In considering the role(s) of artifacts as aspects of \emph{social
identity}, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that people and
artifacts are active agents in the production and maintenance of
\emph{social identity(ies)}. Both categories of artifacts (bottles and
bifaces) contribute to local and regional \emph{communities of identity}
and \emph{communities of practice} \cite{RN8061}. Generally, this
concept may be more easily applied to bottles since they were
manufactured and used by individuals sharing collective \emph{Caddo
identities}. Bifaces (Perdiz arrow points and Gahagan bifaces)
potentially represent multiple \emph{identities}---those being the
Caddo, as users; and non-Caddo, as producers---at least with regard to
chipped stone tools incorporated in mortuary contexts. This idea lends
defensible credence to the concept of morphologically-distinct
\emph{behavioral regions} among the Caddo, while integrating the
possibility of understanding interactions between Caddo and non-Caddo
groups, to include the movement of material culture between Caddo
\emph{behavioral regions}.

Three categories of Caddo material culture differ north and south of the
\emph{shape boundary}, indicating a haecceity of regionally-distinct
perspectives related to production (bottles), and aesthetic
choice/cultural interaction (bifaces). These differing perspectives
incorporate group decisions that include shape, size, form, and
decorative expression, which likely represent the culmination of
generational perspectives \cite{RN5610}. Simply stated, such
perspectives are representative of tradition. Eckert and colleagues
\cite{RN8061} indicate that provenance, the origin or source of an item,
is a significant component of understanding the interrelatedness of
\emph{communities of identity} and \emph{communities of practice}.
Perdiz arrow points and Gahagan bifaces recovered north and south of the
\emph{shape boundary} are morphologically distinct. A second \emph{shape
boundary} demonstrates that Gahagan bifaces differ significantly between
the ancestral Caddo region and central Texas, where they are currently
thought to have been manufactured. This suggests that those
\emph{communities of practice} that articulate with the production of
chipped stone artifacts recovered from Caddo internments, are not Caddo.

It is entirely possible that there are no \emph{communities of practice}
at all for chipped stone artifacts recovered from Caddo mortuary
contexts. However, there do appear to have been \emph{communities of
practice} associated with Perdiz arrow points recovered from
non-mortuary contexts in the ancestral Caddo area, which may more
readily reflect the distinct retouch or resharpening approaches employed
by Caddo knappers \cite{RN9364,RN8486}. Similar interpretations can be
applied to Gahagan bifaces, as few have been reported outside of Caddo
mortuary contexts. It may be more fitting to perceive of Perdiz arrow
points and Gahagan bifaces as indicative of \emph{communities of
identity} rather than \emph{communities of practice}, due to the
contextual discrepancy evinced through mortuary and non-mortuary
settings. The provenance of bifaces from Caddo mortuary contexts can
most assuredly be considered non-local, or produced outside of the
ancestral Caddo region, based on multiple factors that include raw
material, workmanship, morphology, and context.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

This study demonstrated that linear metrics and shape variables
collected for Perdiz arrow points support the \emph{shape boundary}
posited in recent social network and geometric morphometric analyses,
and determined that the same metrics can be used to predict regional
membership. Those morphological features that discriminate between
Perdiz arrow points recovered from each \emph{behavioral region} were
identified using geometric morphometrics, with substantive differences
found to occur in the size and basal morphology of the projectiles.
Blade and base shape were found to be both modular and morphologically
integrated, suggesting that blade and base shapes are predictable. While
evidence from one category---Caddo bottles---supports discussions of
Caddo production, the other two---bifaces---more readily articulate with
production activities outside of the region by non-Caddo makers. Such
production activity is more likely to be localized than exchange
systems, thus assumed to leave a clearer signature \cite{RN7019}.
Further work is warranted to expand the scope of this research program
to include analyses of differential production in the two
\emph{behavioral regions} using a greater diversity of diagnostic Caddo
artifact types.
